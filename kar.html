<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;">KARNATAKA</h1>
<p1>The history of Karnataka goes back more than two thousand years ago. Several great empires and dynasties have ruled over Karnataka and have contributed greatly to the history, culture and development of Karnataka

The impact of kingdoms of Karnataka origin have been felt over other parts of India also. The Chindaka Nagas of central India Gangas, [1] Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta,[note 1] Chalukyas of Vengi,[2] Yadava Dynasty of Devagiri were all of Kannada origin[3] who later took to encouraging local languages.

In the medieval and early modern periods, the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Sultanate became the major powers in Karnataka. The latter disintegrated to form five Deccan Sultanates. The Deccan Sultanates defeated the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565.

After the Anglo-Mysore Wars, where the East India Company defeated the forces of Tipu Sultan, Company Rule began in India. Karnataka was divided between Bombay State, Mysore State and Hyderabad State. Formal rule under the British Crown began in 1858. During this time, railways and airways, as well as modern universities were introduced in Karnataka.

India became Independent in 1947, and according to the States Reorganization Act, 1956, the Kannada-speaking areas of Hyderabad State, Madras State were unified with Mysore State. The state was renamed Karnataka in 1973.
