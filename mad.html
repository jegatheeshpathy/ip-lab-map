<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;">MADHYA PRADESH</h1>
<p1>The history of the Indian state Madhya Pradesh is divided into three periods - the ancient period, the medieval period and modern period.

During the ancient period, the region was dominated by the Nanda Empire, the Maurya Empire, and the Gupta Empire.

The medieval period saw the rise of Rajput clans including the Paramara and Chandela clans, the latter is known for constructing the temples of Khajuraho. The Malwa Sultanate also ruled during this period.

The modern period in Madhya Pradesh saw the rise of the Mughal and Maratha empires, and later, the British Empire.

The British princely states of Gwalior, Indore, and Bhopal, were a part of modern Madhya Pradesh. The British rule continued until the middle of the 20th century, when India gained independence in 1947. The state of Madhya Pradesh was formed in 1956, and Chhattisgarh was carved out from the state in 2000.
